# calc3d

TL;DR: 
1. This is a 3-D math library for game development.
2. Grab `calc3/clac3.h` and use it at once for your renderer development!

When I working on my own renderer, I made this baby `calc3` library.
It is header-only and has implemented farily complete tools for a decent renderer.
The tools includes Quad/Mat/Transform; all functions are tested and used in my own renderer.

I refactored many times on this baby 3-D math library; it is clean and self-explain itself. Hope it will help :)
