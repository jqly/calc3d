# calc3d

TL;DR: 
1. This is a 3-D math library for game development.
2. Grab `calc3/clac3.h` and use it at once for your renderer development!

When I working on my own renderer 2 years ago (2019), I made this baby `calc3` library.
It is header-only and fairly complete for a decent renderer.
The implementation includes Quad/Mat/Transform; all functions are tested and used in my own renderer.

*I refactored many times; now, it is clean and self-explanatory. Hope clac3d will help :)*

### Warning

It is clogged with c++ template/meta stuff that even myself couldn't understand now ðŸ˜‚
